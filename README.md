# MARKET-SEGMENTATION-ANALYSIS
In this project, we aim to segment customers
for a retail business based on various
characteristics such as demographics,
purchasing behavior, and psychographics. By
segmenting customers, the retail business can
tailor its marketing strategies and offerings to
different customer groups, thereby increasing
customer satisfaction and maximizing
profitability.
